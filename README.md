# Git Workflow

## Objectives

- Explain the benefits of branch workflow
- Create branches
- Merge branches
- Resolve merge conflicts

## Notes

- Explain the benefits of branch workflow
  - So we're not all commiting to same branch
  - Allows a bunch of people to work on same codebase at once (SAFELY)
  - Allows you to review code before committing changes (specifically to master)
  - Allows you to break up the work into smaller chunks
    * Feature
    * Task
    * Release
